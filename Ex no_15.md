# EX 15 C program that reads a one-dimensional array of integers and replaces all even elements with 'E'.
## AIM:
To write a C program that reads a one-dimensional array of integers and replaces all even elements with 'E'.

## Algorithm
1. Start. 
2. Declare a array size value of type int. 
3. Prompt the user to enter a value. 
4. Read the value using scanf. 
5. Initialize array elements. 
6. Replace all even elements to E 
7. End. 
## Program:
```

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int n, i;
    scanf("%d", &n);

    int a[n];
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        if (a[i] % 2 == 0)
            printf("E ");
        else
            printf("%d ", a[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
 
```
